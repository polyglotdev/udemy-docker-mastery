## Image vs Container

- Image: the application we want to run
- Container: is an instance of that image running as a process
- You can have many containers running off the same image

## Starting an Nginx Container

```bash
docker container run -p 80:80 --name webhost -d nginx
```

1. Downloaded image nginx from DH
2. started new container from that image
3. Opened port 80 on host IP
4. Routes that traffic to the container IP, port 80

## Container are not Mini-VMs

- They are just processes. They are not tied to the host OS, they are isolated processes.
- Limited to what resources they can access
- Exit when the process stops unless `--rm` flag is used

## Homework

- docs.docker.com and `--help` are your friend
- Run an nginx, a mysql, and a httpd (apache) server
- Run all of `--detach` or `-d`, name them all with `--name`
- nginx should listen on `80:80`, httpd on `8080:80`, mysql on `3312:3306`
- When running mysql, use the `--env` option to pass in `MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes`

## Whats going on in Containers

- `docker container top <container_id>`: process list in one container
- `docker container inspect <container_id>`: details of one container config
- `docker container stats <container_id>`: performance stats for all containers

## Getting a shell inside containers

- `docker container run -it`: start new container interactively
- `docker container exec -it`: run additional command in existing container
- Different Linux distros have different commands to get a shell in a container
  - Some use `sh`, some use `bash`

## Docker Networks: Concepts

- Each container connected to a private virtual network "bridge"
- Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP
- All containers on a virtual network can talk to each other without `-p`
- Best practice is to create a new virtual network for each app
- Battery included, but removable
- `docker container run --network <network_name>`: attach a container to a virtual network
- `docker network ls`: show networks
- `docker network inspect <network_name>`: show details of that network
- `docker network create --driver`: create a new virtual network
- `docker network connect`: attach a network to a container
- `docker network disconnect`: detach a network from a container
- `--network-alias`: add an alias to a container's hostname
- `--link`: legacy way to connect containers
- `Docker0`: default virtual network

## Docker Networks: CLI Management

- `docker network ls`: show networks
- `docker network inspect <network_name>`: show details of that network
- `docker network create --driver`: create a new virtual network
- `docker network connect`: attach a network to a container
- `docker network disconnect`: detach a network from a container
- `--network-alias`: add an alias to a container's hostname
- `--link`: legacy way to connect containers
- `Docker0`: default virtual network

## Docker Networks: DNS

- Understand how DNS is the key to easy inter-container comms
- See how it works by default with custom networks
- Learn how to use `--link` to enable DNS round robin style discovery

### Forget IPs, use DNS

- Containers should use FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) to talk to each other
- Its too dynamic to try and manage IPs for containers
- Docker daemon has a built-in DNS server for containers on the same network

## Assignment Requirement: CLI App Testing

- Check curl version in ubuntu:14.04 and centos:7
- ensure curl is installed on latest version for that distro
- `docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && curl --version"`
- `docker run --rm -it centos:7 /bin/bash -c "yum update -y && yum install -y curl && curl --version"`

## What is DNS?

DNS(Domain Name System) is a system that translates domain names to IP addresses. It is a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of name servers. Here is what happens when you use DNS

1. Lookup Request: Your device asks a DNS server for the IP address associated with a particular domain name.
2. Response: The DNS server responds with the corresponding IP address.

DNS is often described as the "phone book of the internet." Without it, we would have to remember IP addresses instead of domain names.

## DNS and Docker

n Docker, DNS is crucial for service discovery and the management of containers, especially when dealing with multi-container setups and orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. Hereâ€™s how DNS ties into Docker:

- Container Networking: Docker uses DNS to manage container networking. When you create a new container, Docker automatically assigns it a unique IP address and a DNS name.
- Service Discovery: DNS is used to discover services running in other containers. Containers can communicate with each other using their DNS names.

## Assignment: DNS Round Robin Test

- Create a new virtual network
- Create two containers from `elasticsearch:2`
- Research and use `--network-alias search` when creating them to give them an additional DNS name to respond to
- Run `alpine nslookup search` with `--net` to see the two containers list for the same DNS name
- Run `centos curl -s search:9200` with `--net` multiple times until you see both containers respond
- Extra Credit: Run a single `centos` container and use `--net` to run `curl` against the `search` alias in a loop, see it hit both containers

## Commands from DNS Round Robin Test

```bash
docker network create elasticsearch
docker run -d --network elasticsearch --name elasticsearch1 --network-alias search elasticsearch
docker run -d --network elasticsearch --name elasticsearch2 --network-alias search elasticsearch
docker run --rm --network elasticsearch alpine nslookup search
```

## Container Images

## This Section

- all about images
- what is an image
- Docker Hub registry
- Managing our own local image
- Build our own image

## What is an Image and what it is not?

- app binaries and dependencies
- metadata about the image data and how to run the image
- Official definition: An image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime.
- Not complete OS. No kernel, kernel modules (e.g. drivers): The host provides the kernel, and modules, and the container runs on that kernel
- Small as one file like golang static binary
- Big as Ubuntu distro with apt, apache, php, and more installed

## Image Layers

- Images are made up of file system changes and metadata
- union file system (UFS) is a way to layer files
- history and inspect commands
- copy on write

## Docker tags

In Docker, a **tag** is a label applied to an image in a Docker registry that distinguishes different images or different versions of the same image. Tags are used to specify different versions of an image that are available, such as different versions of an operating system, different versions of a software application, or different builds of an application configured for specific purposes.

### Understanding Docker Tags

1. Basic Usage

A Docker image tag provides a convenient way to reference different versions of the same image. For example, if you have a series of images for the `ubuntu` operating system, you might have tags for each version:

- `ubuntu:18.04`
- `ubuntu:20.04`
- `ubuntu:latest`

In this example, `18.04` and `20.04` are specific versions of Ubuntu, while `latest` typically refers to the most recent stable version.

1. Components of a Tag

A Docker tag usually includes the image's repository name, followed by a colon, and the tag itself. For example:

```bash
nginx:latest
```

- **Repository Name**: `nginx`
- **Tag**: `latest`

3. Purpose and Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Tags can be used to manage different versions of applications. It is a common practice to use semantic versioning tags (like `2.5.1`, `2.5.2`, etc.) for production deployments to ensure environment consistency.
- **Environment Specific Tags**: Tags can also indicate configurations specific to environments, such as `development`, `testing`, and `production`, which may have different application settings or dependencies.
- **Builds or Revisions**: In CI/CD pipelines, tags might include build numbers or other identifiers that link the Docker image to a specific build in a build system.

### Example: Tagging an Image

When you build a Docker image, you can specify a tag with the `docker build` command:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

Here, `myapp` is the repository name, and `1.0` is the tag. Without a specified tag, Docker will default to using the `latest` tag.

### Pushing and Pulling with Tags

**Pushing an Image:**

To push an image to a Docker registry, you specify the tag:

```bash
docker push myapp:1.0
```

**Pulling an Image:**

To pull a specific version of an image from a Docker registry:

```bash
docker pull myapp:1.0
```

If no tag is specified during pull, Docker defaults to `latest`, which can lead to confusion if you expect the `latest` tag to be up-to-date with the most recent version of the image source code (it only refers to the "latest pushed" version).

### Tags and the Latest Pitfall

A common pitfall in using Docker tags is over-reliance on the `latest` tag. Since `latest` can refer to whatever was last pushed to the "latest" tag in the repository, it may not actually represent the most current version of the application. It's considered best practice in production environments to use specific, versioned tags to avoid unexpected changes.

## Persistent Data: Volumes

- defining the problem of persistent data
- key concepts with containers: immutable, ephemeral
- persistent data: databases, files, etc
- Bind mounts
- Assignments

## Container Lifetime & Persistent Data: Volumes

- Containers are usually immutable and ephemeral
- "immutable infrastructure": only re-deploy containers, never change
- This is the ideal scenario, but what about databases, or unique data?
- Docker gives us features to ensure these "separation of concerns"
- Two ways: Volumes and Bind Mounts
- Volumes: make special location outside of container UFS
- Bind Mounts: link container path to host path

## Persistent Data: Volumes Walkthrough

- `docker container run -d --name psql -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres`
- `docker run -d --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=passwrd -v psql-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5433:5432 postgres`
- `docker run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True -p 3308:3306 -v mysql-db:/var/lib/mysql mysql`
- `docker inspect mysql | jq '.[].Mounts'`

## Create a volume

If you need to specify a driver on your volume you can create it ahead of time instead of the run command creating it for you.

## Persistent Data: Bind Mounts

- Maps a host file or directory to a container file or directory
- Basically just two locations pointing to the same file(s)
- Again, skips UFS, and host files overwrite any in container
- Can't use in Dockerfile, must be at `container run`
- `...run -v /Users/dom//stuff:/path/to/container`

## Assignment: Named Volumes

- Database upgrade with containers
- create a `postgres`(v: 9.6.1) container with named volume `psql-data` volume

## Docker Compose

- Why: configure relationships between containers
- Why: save our `docker container run` settings in easy-to-read file
- Why: create one-liner developer environment startups
- Comprised of 2 separate but related things:
  - YAML-formatted file that describes our solution options for:
    - containers
    - networks
    - volumes
  - A CLI tool `docker-compose` used for local dev/test automation with those YAML files

## `docker-compose.yml` file

- Compose YAML format as it's own versions
- `docker-compose.yml` file is a YAML file that defines how Docker containers should behave in production
- With docker directly in prod with Swarm

## Things you need in a `docker-compose.yml` file

1. Version
2. Services
   1. servicename
      1. image: optional
      2. ports: optional
      3. environment variables: optional
      4. volumes: optional
3. Networks
4. Volumes

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  servicename:
    image: imagename
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    environment:
      - key: value
    volumes:
      - volumename:/path/in/container
    networks:
      - networkname
```

- docker-compose is not a production-grade tool, but it is great for development and testing.
- comes with most installs besides linux

## Using Compose to Build

- compose can build your custom images
- `docker-compose up --build` will build the images before starting the containers if not found in the cache
- Great for complex builds that have lots of vars or build args

## Containers Everywhere = New Problems

- How do we automate container lifecycle?
- How can we easily scale out/in/up/down?
- How can we ensure container are recreated if they fail?
- How do we replace containers without downtime (blue/green deploy)?
- How can we share environment variables and secrets in a secure way?
- How can we manage networking?
- How can we monitor the health of our containers?

## Swarm Mode: Built-In Orchestration

Join:

```bash
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3dq7w2u5ij8agdean54br3olh5lrbx6uxsrdiaqc2ew5u74wxs-9wq1khvzyi7a3wf0elc0jrlbq 192.168.65.3:2377
```

- Swarm Mode is clustering solution built inside Docker
- Not related to Swarm "classic" for pre-1.12 versions
- Added in 1.12, 2016 via SwarmKit toolkit
- Enhanced in 1.13, 2017 via Stacks and Secrets

## docker swarm init: What just happened?

- Lots of PKI and security automation
  - Root Signing Certificate created for our Swarm
  - Certificate is issued for first Manager node
  - Join tokens are created
- Raft database created to store root CA, configs, and secrets
  - Encrypted by default on disk (1.13+)
  - No Need for another keu/value system to hold orchestration state/secrets
  - Replicates logs amongst Managers via mutual TLS in "control plane"

> When you are looking at the replicas in the swarm the first number represents how many are actually running and the second number represents how many are desired.

## Overlay Multi-Host Networking

- Just choose `--driver overlay` when creating
- For container-to-container traffic inside a single Swarm
- Optional IPSec (AES) encryption for security
- Each service can be connected to multiple networks
  - "Frontend" network, "Backend" network

## Routing Mesh

- Automatically routes incoming requests to proper service
- Routers ingress (incoming) packets for a Service to proper Task
- Uses IPVS from Linux Kernel
- Load balances swarm Services across their Tasks
- Two ways this works:
  - Container-to-container in a overlay network(VIP)
  - External traffic incoming to published ports (all nodes listen)

## Kubernetes

- Open-source container orchestration platform
- Originally designed by Google, now maintained by CNCF(Cloud Native Computing Foundation)
- Uses declarative configuration
- Self-healing
- Scaling
- Rolling updates

## Kubernetes Concepts

The command you've shared is intended to retrieve information about the nodes in a Kubernetes cluster and format the output using the `jq` tool. Here's a breakdown of the command and its components:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o json | jq ".items[] | {name: .metadata.name} + .status.capacity"
```

### Breakdown of the Command:

1. **`kubectl get nodes -o json`**:

- `kubectl` is the command line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
- `get nodes` retrieves information about all the nodes (physical or virtual machines) in the cluster.
- `-o json` formats the output of the command as JSON. This is useful for piping into `jq`, which can manipulate JSON data effectively.

2. **`| jq ".items[] | {name: .metadata.name} + .status.capacity"`**:

- `|` is the pipe operator in Unix-like systems that passes the output of the previous command as input to the following command.
- `jq` is a powerful tool for parsing and manipulating JSON data from the command line.
- `".items[]"` takes each item in the "items" array from the JSON output. Each item represents a node in the Kubernetes cluster.
- `|` (within the `jq` command) is a filter that pipes the output of one `jq` expression into another.
- `{name: .metadata.name}` creates a new JSON object for each node with a single key (`name`) that is populated with the node's name from the `.metadata.name` field of the input JSON.
- `+ .status.capacity` adds all key-value pairs from the `.status.capacity` field of the input JSON to the aforementioned object. The `capacity` object typically includes data such as CPU resources, memory, and possibly extended resources like GPUs.

### Example Output:

Assuming you have a cluster with nodes that have various capacities, the command might produce output like this:

```json
{
  "name": "node1",
  "cpu": "4",
  "memory": "16Gi",
  "pods": "110"
}
{
  "name": "node2",
  "cpu": "8",
  "memory": "32Gi",
  "pods": "110"
}
```

This output provides a clear, concise view of each node's name and its capacity regarding CPU, memory, and maximum pod allocations.

### Usage Scenario:

This command is particularly useful for sysadmins and Kubernetes operators who need a quick and readable overview of node capacities within their clusters. It helps in scenarios where decisions regarding resource management and workload scheduling are needed.

### Introduction to `jq`

`jq` is a powerful command-line JSON processor. It allows you to slice, filter, map, and transform structured data with the same ease that `sed`, `awk`, `grep`, and friends let you play with text.

#### Basic `jq` Syntax:

- `.`: Represents the root object/entire input.
- `[]`: Access elements in an array or build new arrays.
- `{}`: Build new JSON objects.
- `|`: Pipe output from one filter to another.

### Example JSON Data

Let's consider a JSON that describes some nodes in a network:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "node1",
      "ip": "192.168.1.1",
      "roles": ["master", "worker"]
    },
    {
      "name": "node2",
      "ip": "192.168.1.2",
      "roles": ["worker"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Basic Queries

1. **Print the whole JSON**:

  ```bash
  jq '.' data.json
  ```

2. **Print all nodes**:

  ```bash
  jq '.nodes[]' data.json
  ```

3. **Print names of all nodes**:
  ```bash
  jq '.nodes[].name' data.json
  ```

### Transformations with `jq`

1. **Map Format**: Creating a new JSON structure.

  ```bash
  jq '.nodes[] | {node_name: .name, node_ip: .ip}' data.json
  ```

  Output:

  ```json
  {"node_name": "node1", "node_ip": "192.168.1.1"}
  {"node_name": "node2", "node_ip": "192.168.1.2"}
  ```

2. **Filter by Role**: Only get workers.
  ```bash
  jq '.nodes[] | select(.roles[] == "worker")' data.json
  ```

### Introduction to `yq`

While `jq` is used for JSON, `yq` is a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor, which is similar in spirit to `jq`.

#### Basic `yq` Syntax:

- Similar to `jq` but adapted for YAML data.
- Commands and operations are analogous to those in `jq`.

### Example YAML Data

Suppose you have a YAML file named `data.yaml`:

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: node1
    ip: 192.168.1.1
    roles:
      - master
      - worker
  - name: node2
    ip: 192.168.1.2
    roles:
      - worker
```

#### Basic Queries with `yq`

1. **Print the whole YAML**:

  ```bash
  yq e '.' data.yaml
  ```

2. **Print all nodes**:

  ```bash
  yq e '.nodes[]' data.yaml
  ```

3. **Print names of all nodes**:
  ```bash
  yq e '.nodes[].name' data.yaml
  ```

### Transformations with `yq`

1. **Map Format**: Creating a new YAML structure.

  ```bash
  yq e '.nodes[] | {"node_name": .name, "node_ip": .ip}' data.yaml
  ```

2. **Filter by Role**: Only get workers.
  ```bash
  yq e '.nodes[] | select(.roles[] == "worker")' data.yaml
  ```

### Summary

Both `jq` and `yq` are invaluable tools for scripting in environments where JSON or YAML configurations are prevalent (such as Kubernetes). They allow for precise querying and manipulation of structured data, making them ideal for automated scripts and systems administration tasks.

## kubectl describe

- `kubectl describe` is a powerful command in Kubernetes that provides detailed information about various Kubernetes resources, such as pods, services, deployments, and more.
- To use the command, you need to add `node/nodename` like the following `kubectl describe node/node-name`. You can also use `kubectl describe node nodename` to get the same information.

## `kubectl api-resources`

```bash

So above you can see things like the shortnames, the api version, whether it is namespaced or not, and the kind of resource it is. We can list the resources types with `kubectl api-resources`.

- We can view the definition for a resource type with: `kubectl explain pod`
- We can view the definition of a field in a resource type with: `kubectl explain pod.spec.containers`
- Or get the list of all fields and subfields with: `kubectl explain pod --recursive`

## WTF is `kind`

1. `kind` as a Kubernetes Object Field

In Kubernetes, every object definition includes a `kind` field in its `yaml` or `json` representation. The `kind` field specifies the type of object being defined. For example, a `kind` value of `Pod` indicates that the object is a pod definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

In this example:

- `kind: Deployment`: This tells Kubernetes that the resource type you are defining is a Deployment.

2. `kind` as a Kubernetes Cluster tool

**kind** (Kubernetes IN Docker) is a tool designed to run local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes." kind is primarily used for testing Kubernetes itself, but it is also suitable for development and CI environments. It is not recommended for production use. The main appeal of kind is that it is lightweight, quick to set up, and runs on most hardware that supports Docker.

## Introspection vs documentation

- `kubectl explain` is a powerful tool for understanding Kubernetes resources and their fields.
- It provides detailed information about the structure and attributes of Kubernetes objects.
- `kubectl explain` can be used to explore the available fields, subfields, and possible values for each resource type.
- It is a valuable resource for learning about Kubernetes resources and how to configure them effectively.
- `kubectl explain` and `kubectl api-resources` are performing introspection because they communicate with the API server and obtain the exact details of the resources and their attributes.
